#How to sell a project

##What is this?
This is the biz dev doodie’s attempt to organize Datascope’s abundance of templates, documentation, biz dev strategies, and ideas on how to provide information to potential clients in the best way possible. Hopefully this will also be a great place for Datascopers to go when they want guidance on how to go from conversations to signed contracts.
